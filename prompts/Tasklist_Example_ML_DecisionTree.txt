1. Analyze the research question
1.1 Identify the main components of the research question
1.2 Define the concepts and terms involved (ensemble, decision trees, Random Forest, regression problems)

2. Conduct a literature review using the similarity search function
2.1 Find relevant books and papers addressing decision trees and their ensembles
2.2 Review the strengths and weaknesses of single decision trees and ensemble methods
2.3 Identify key metrics used to evaluate performance in regression problems
2.4 Summarize previous findings on the comparison between single decision trees and ensembles

3. Develop the methodology for the assignment paper
3.1 Outline the criteria for selecting relevant studies
3.2 Define performance metrics for comparison (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared)
3.3 Choose appropriate statistical tests for comparing performance (e.g., t-test, ANOVA)

4. Analyze and compare the selected studies using the similarity search function
4.1 Retrieve relevant study results and findings on single decision trees
4.2 Retrieve relevant study results and findings on ensemble methods, such as Random Forest
4.3 Perform statistical tests to compare the performance of single decision trees and ensembles

5. Synthesize the findings

5.2 Discuss the results of the performance comparison
5.3 Address any limitations or biases found in the selected studies

6. Draw conclusions and formulate recommendations
6.1 Assess whether ensemble methods, such as Random Forest, consistently outperform single decision trees in regression problems
6.2 Discuss the implications of the findings for practitioners and researchers
6.3 Suggest areas for future research and improvements

7. Write the assignment paper
7.1 Organize the content following a logical structure (e.g., introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion)
7.2 Cite relevant sources using a consistent citation style
7.3 Edit and proofread the paper for clarity, coherence, and grammatical correctness

8. Finalize the assignment paper
